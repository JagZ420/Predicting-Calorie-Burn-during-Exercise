In this project, I undertake the task of estimating calorie burn during exercise sessions using machine learning models. The objective is to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate calorie expenditure based on a set of input features, including heart rate, body temperature, duration of exercise, and other relevant variables. To achieve this, I have applied a range of ML models, each with its unique characteristics and capabilities, to analyse and predict calorie burn. 
It was verified that the variable that most influences the burning of calories is duration, followed by heart rate and body temperature. However, only with the considerations of all sets of features was possible to reduce the error to less than 1% of the mean.
